## 1 Critique of Original Visualization
The original visualization is shown below.

![](img/original.jpg)

### 1.1	Clarity
- The title and the y-axis of the graph does not show the unit of the trade value. In the dataset, the trade value has two kinds of units, which is thousand dollars and million dollars. So it might make people confused if we do not specify the unit of the value.
- The label of x-axis is month of period, but in fact the x-axis shows different years not different month.
- The original visualization used area chart which could misleading people to compare the height of import and export in the chart. However, the chart has two different y-axis for import and export and their scale is also different.

### 1.2	Aesthetic
- The title and the graph are not aligned.
- The width of charts for different regions are not the same.
- The x-axis uses tick marks on categorical scale.
- The color of the area makes the overlapped part of the trend line not very clear to see.
- The two different y-axis for import and export are not differentiated by color.

## 2 Makeover Design
The makeover design is shown below:

![](img/design.jpg)

### 2.1	Clarity
- The unit of the trading values is added to the sheet title, which is thousand dollars. And all the numerical data in the dataset is already convert to this unit.
- The x-axis represent month and the label of axis is revised accordingly.
- Instead of using area chart, the makeover design used lines to represent the data.
- The average reference lines are added to make it easier to see the scale of the data.
- A tooltip is added to highlight the key information at each data point.

### 2.2	Aesthetic
- The title and the graph are set to be aligned.
- The width of charts for different regions are set to be the same.
- The x-axis removed original tick marks.
- The two different y-axis for import and export are differentiated by using different color.

## 3 Proposed Visualization

## 5 Derived Insights

1.	We can see that there is a significant decline trend between 2020 March and 2020 May both in Asia and worldwide. For the total merchandise trade, the trade imports decreased around 22% and trade exports decreased around 20%, which changed just within two months. This might due to the breakout of Covid throughout the world. And we can refer to the chart of Mainland China, there is also a dramatic decrease from the end of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, which may due to that the breakout of Covid in China is earlier than in the other countries.
2.	The scale of imports and exports of Hong Kong is very different, the imports of Hong Kong between 2019 and 2021 is only around 1M thousand dollars, but the exports reached around 5M thousand dollars, nearly 5 times of imports. This may because Hong Kong is a free-trade port and its trading policy is much different with China Mainland, which makes it easier to do some export trading.
3.	Observing the chart of US, we can see that the exports of US increased rapidly from the end of 2019 to early 2020, compared with 2019 September, the exports increased more than 56%. One reason may be that the government published several policies to increase the exports to China in order to reduce the trading deficit.
